# Introduction to Supervised Learning

The problem of supervised learning is to predict a certain quantity (this is known as the **target** variable) that we are interested in using some other quantities that we have measured (these are known as **predictor** variables), which are often directly or indirectly related to the quantity of interest.



A good learning algorithm will:
- be stable: the output should not change drastically if the input is slightly perturbed
- be efficient: it should be able to learn and predict relatively efficiently as a function of data size
- be robust: it should be able to do well on unseen data

- introduce SL
- Give examples, e.g. Classification or Regression
Supervised Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that tries to predict known values (we can this **target variables**)

## Notation

In general, we assume that our predictor variables are represented by a matrix,
$\underline{\underline{X}}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$
