# Machine Learning First Principles

This book is a continuously updated collection of notes that I've gathered over time on Machine Learning (ML) methods. It is intended to be used as a 'handbook' for classical ML tools. Therefore when writing this, I've had the following in mind:
- The book sections must be short
- Each method should be explained at a high level with clear examples and diagrams
- Model assumptions, pros and cons should be stated clearly
- Implementations should be readable and have complexities associated with them
- Each section should clearly point to relevant resources for further reading

## Intended Audience and Prerequisites

This book is best thought of as a handbook, so it is appropriate for anyone who needs a refresher on ML models. It is also good for beginners, but they are advised to follow the relevant links for more detail if necessary, since the book is not exhaustive.

In terms of prerequisites, you should have a basic familiarity with statistics, linear algebra and calculus.
